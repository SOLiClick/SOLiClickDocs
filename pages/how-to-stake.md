How to Stake
============

Ready to stake your Click-Me tokens and chill while the SOL rolls in? Here’s the full scoop on staking, claiming, and cashing out.

-------------------------

You’ll need a Solana wallet with Click-Me tokens and a sprinkle of SOL for fees. It’s all on-chain, so it’s safe, clear, and vibes hard.

**Checklist:**

\- Solana wallet with CLICKME tokens - 0.01-0.02 SOL per transaction - Know the 7-day lockup deal (stake & unstake)

---------------------------------------------------

Head to the “Staking” tab on the Click-Me site. Connect your wallet if you haven’t—smash “Connect Wallet,” pick your poison, and approve. Boom, you’ll see your token stash, staked amount, and any rewards waiting.

Step 1: Initialize the Party

First stake? You’ll sign two transactions—first to kick off your staking account (costs a tiny bit of SOL), second to lock in your tokens. Approve it, and your blockchain record’s live in seconds.

Two-step dance with 7-day waits—keeps it stable but lets you dip.

###

Request It

Post-7 days, hit “Unstake,” pick your amount (partial’s cool), and sign. Tokens chill in “pending” mode for 7 more days, no rewards during this stretch.

###

After the countdown, “Claim Unstaked Tokens” lights up. Smash it, sign, and your tokens bounce back to your wallet—free to flex again.
