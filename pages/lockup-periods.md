Lockup Periods
==============

Click-Me’s got two 7-day lockups to keep the ecosystem tight. Here’s how they mess with your moves.

The Double Lockdown


-------------------------------------------------

Two timers, one goal: stability.

Staking and unstaking lockup periods

###

Stake Lockup: 7 Days of Chill

*   **When:** Starts at stake time.
    
*   **Why:** Stops flip-flop nonsense.
    
*   **Vibes:** Tokens earn rewards, but no unstaking ‘til Day 7.
    

### 

[](#unstake-lockup-7-more-days)

Unstake Lockup: 7 More Days

*   **When:** Kicks off at unstake request.
    
*   **Why:** Keeps it predictable, no flash exits.
    
*   **Vibes:** Tokens sit, no rewards, claimable post-7.
    

**Full Run:**

Day 0: Stake Day 7: Request unstake Day 14: Claim tokens

* * *

Watch Out: Stake Adds Reset Everything


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Heads Up:** New stake? ALL your tokens relock for 7 days.

Add tokens mid-game, and the clock restarts for the whole pile. Example:

*   Day 0: Stake 100, locked ‘til 7.
    
*   Day 5: Add 50, ALL 150 locked ‘til 12.
    

Big stakes, less often = less headache.

Unstake Trap: More Requests, More Waiting


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Yo:** New unstake request resets the timer for ALL pending tokens.

Pile on requests, and they lump together with a fresh 7-day wait:

*   Day 7: Unstake 50, claimable Day 14.
    
*   Day 10: Add 30, ALL 80 wait ‘til 17.
    

One big unstake’s your friend—don’t spam it.

Play It Smart


-------------------------------------

*   **Stake:** Go big, time adds near lockup ends.
    
*   **Unstake:** One shot, no extras ‘til it’s done.
    
*   **Tech:** No cancels, blockchain-enforced, rewards stop post-request.
    

Plan your lockup game, and you’ll flex liquidity like a boss.
