How It Works, Fam


--------------------------------------------

*   **Stakers:** Snag 5% of every SOL that slides through—cha-ching!
    
*   **Developers:** Pocket 5% of every SOL to keep the magic alive.
    

This slick, even split keeps the crew thriving and the dev train screaming full steam ahead.
