[](#reward-distribution-issues)

Reward Distribution Issues


---------------------------------------------------------------

### 

[](#missing-winner-rewards)

Missing Winner Rewards

**Symptoms:**

*   You were the last clicker but didn't receive rewards
    
*   Winner rewards seem smaller than the displayed pot
    

**Solutions:**

1.  Verify a new game has been started (rewards are distributed on new game start)
    
2.  Check the transaction history on a Solana explorer
    
3.  Confirm you were truly the last clicker (someone might have clicked after you)
    
4.  Verify you're checking the correct wallet address for rewards
    
5.  Contact support with the game ID and transaction details
    

### 

[](#staking-rewards-lower-than-expected)

Staking Rewards Lower Than Expected

**Symptoms:**

*   Claimed rewards are less than displayed
    
*   Reward estimate seems too low
    

**Solutions:**

1.  Remember rewards are proportional to your share of the total staked amount
    
2.  Check recent game activity (fewer games = fewer rewards)
    
3.  Verify when you staked (rewards only accumulate after staking)
    
4.  Understand that the interface shows estimates that might change with market conditions
    
5.  Check your calculation against the formula: `Your Rewards = Total Rewards ร (Your Stake รท Total Staked)`
