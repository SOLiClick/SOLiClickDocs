Yo, the soul of Click-Me is all about that click life. Master this, and you’re halfway to snagging that fat prize pool.

Click Costs: Pay Up or Shut Up


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Every game kicks off with a slick 0.01 SOL click cost, but don’t get comfy—each tap jacks it up by 0.01 SOL. It’s a wild ride of risk vs. reward, where you’re sweating over whether that growing pot is worth the extra juice. Early clicks? Cheap as chips. Late clicks? You’re basically flexing your SOL stacks.

Click Number

Cost (SOL)

1

0.01

10

0.10

50

0.50

100

1.00

By click 100, you’re dropping 1.24 SOL—five times the starter fee! Timing’s everything, fam.

Timer Vibes: Tick-Tock, Who’s the Top Dog?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every click resets the timer to a fat 3 minutes. It’s like a countdown to glory, keeping you on edge as you eyeball that clock. Early resets give the squad time to steal your throne, but wait too long, and some sneaky ninja might snipe it at the buzzer. When it hits zero, the last clicker’s crowned—simple, savage, and blockchain-verified.

**Timer Truth:** 3 minutes is the sweet spot—long enough to plot, short enough to keep your heart racing.

Fee Split: Where the SOL Goes


--------------------------------------------------------------------

Every click’s a cash piñata, split three ways:

**The Breakdown:**

*   **90% Prize Vault:** Fattens the winner’s bag.
    
*   **5% Dev Wallet:** Keeps the lights on and the code crispy.
    
*   **5% Staking Pool:** Pays the chill squad staking tokens.
    

That 90% pumps the prize pool like a bodybuilder on leg day, while the rest keeps the ecosystem vibin’. Stakers get their cut without lifting a finger—sweet deal, right?

Click Check: No Funny Business


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Every tap’s locked down with blockchain magic—game state, wallet balance, signatures, all triple-checked. It’s tamper-proof and open for you to peek at. Here’s the techy flow:

**How It Pops Off:**

1\. Check game state & your SOL stash 2. Send the SOL where it’s gotta go 3. Reset timer, crown new leader 4. Update the stats for flexin’

Master these mechanics, and you’ll be clicking your way to glory—or at least laughing while you try!
