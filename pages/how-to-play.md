How to Play
===========

Click-Me’s easy to jump into, but winning’s a whole vibe. Here’s the rundown from wallet hookup to cashing out.

[](#get-in-the-game)

Get in the Game


-----------------------------------------

You’ll need a Solana wallet (Phantom, Solflare, whatever) loaded with SOL for fees and clicks. Want in on staking? Grab some Click-Me tokens, but they’re optional for the main gig.

**Gear Up Checklist:**

✓ Solana wallet

✓ SOL for the grind

✓ Tokens (if staking)

###

Hook Up Your Wallet

Hit the Click-Me site, smash “Connect Wallet” up top, pick your flavor, and approve it. Boom—your address pops up, and you’re in the squad.

The Game Screen: What’s Poppin’


----------------------------------------------------------------------

The interface is your battle map:

*   **Timer:** How long ‘til the crown’s claimed.
    
*   **Click Cost:** What you’re coughing up now.
    
*   **Prize Pool:** The juicy pot you’re chasing.
    
*   **Last Clicker:** Who’s flexing as leader.
    

**Pro Tip:** Eyeball these before you dive in—timer, cost, pot, leader. Know the stakes!

Kick Off a New Round


---------------------------------------------------

No game running? Be the hero—hit “Start New Game” for 3 SOL. Your wallet confirms, the timer fires up, and you’re the first kingpin. Plus, it auto-pays the last winner their loot. Cycle of life, baby.

**FYI:** New game = old winner gets paid. Keeps the wheels spinning.

Jump In Mid-Game


-------------------------------------------

Game’s live? Smash “CLICK-ME!” and pay the current fee (starts at 0.01 SOL, climbs 0.01 per click). Confirm it, reset the timer to 3, and flex as the new top dog. Hold that spot ‘til zero, and the pot’s yours.

Cash Out: The Victory Lap


------------------------------------------------------------

Timer hits zero, and if you’re the last clicker, you’ve won! But hold up—your SOL lands when someone starts the next game. That 3 SOL kickoff triggers your payout.

**Heads Up:** No new game, no payout yet. Someone’s gotta keep the party going!

[](#stack-with-staking)

Stack with Staking


-----------------------------------------------

Wanna double-dip? Stake tokens and snag 5% of all fees without clicking. Check the staking section for the deets—active or passive, you’re winning either way.

**Let’s Go!** Wallet up, click in, and chase that bag!
