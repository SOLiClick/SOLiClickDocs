Game Overview
=============

Click-Me’s a last-clicker-wins brawl where timing and guts decide who’s eating good.

The Gist


---------------------------

Built on Solana, Click-Me’s simple but savage:

1.  3-minute timer ticks down.
    
2.  Click to reset it and flex as leader.
    
3.  Timer zero = last clicker bags the pot.
    

It’s a tense standoff where every move counts.

The Cycle of Chaos


-----------------------------------------------

**🚀 Start It Up** Probably dev will start, so no worries there.

**🎮 Play Hard** Click to steal the crown—costs more each time, pumping the pot and staking vibes.

**🏆 Endgame** Timer’s done, last clicker wins. Next game kicks off the payout party.

Strategy Sauce


---------------------------------------

Start a game for 3 SOL, next fool clicks for 0.01 SOL—300x return if they hold it! Pot grows wild as clicks stack up. Each tap:

*   Resets to 3 minutes.
    
*   Ups the fee.
    
*   Fattens the prize.
    

**Catch:** Last winner gets paid when the next game starts. Keeps the cycle spicy and stakers happy with their 5% cut.
