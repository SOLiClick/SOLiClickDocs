Staking Questions


---------------------------------------------

### 

[](#why-did-my-staking-timer-reset)

Why did my staking timer reset?

Timers reset if you add more tokens to your unstaked or staked balance. Each section has its own timer that acts independently of the other. For example, if you add more tokens to your staked balance, your staked balance timer resets, not your unstaked timer, and vice versa.

### 

[](#why-are-my-staking-rewards-not-updating-immediately-after-each-new-click)

Why are my staking rewards not updating immediately after each new click?

The backend takes time to process rewards and properly reflect it on the front end. Rest assured your rewards will appear when the API call is fetched.

### 

[](#how-often-are-staking-rewards-distributed)

How often are staking rewards distributed?

Staking rewards are distributed in real-time as game activity occurs. However, there may be a slight delay in the UI reflecting these rewards due to API call timing.

### 

[](#is-there-a-minimum-amount-required-for-staking)

Is there a minimum amount required for staking?

There is no minimum amount required for staking Click-Me tokens. You can stake any amount you own, even small quantities. Please note, however, the larger the stake that you have, the more rewards that you will earn.

### 

[](#how-do-i-claim-my-staking-rewards)

How do I claim my staking rewards?

You can claim your staking rewards by clicking the "Claim" button in the staking interface. Note that you will need to pay a small network transaction fee to process the claim.

Gameplay Questions


-----------------------------------------------

### 

[](#bots-are-going-to-win-so-why-should-i-play)

Bots are going to win, so why should I play?

Bots are not disadvantaged here, considering the nature of the blockchain everyone is fair to compete. While the blockchain game does use timestamps instead of slots, this ensures that bots cannot set transactions based on slot or blockheight. However, if you think that bots will win, you can still earn your share of the pot by simply staking and collecting rewards.

### 

[](#how-does-the-fee-structure-work-for-clicks)

How does the fee structure work for clicks?

The first click costs 0.25 SOL, and each subsequent click increases by 0.01 SOL. For example, the second click costs 0.26 SOL, the third click costs 0.27 SOL, and so on. Of these fees, 90% goes to the prize vault, 5% to development, and 5% to stakers.

### 

[](#what-happens-if-my-transaction-fails)

What happens if my transaction fails?

If your transaction fails due to network congestion or other issues, you will not be charged for the click (aside from the network fee for the failed transaction). You can try again when the network is less congested.

### 

[](#how-do-i-know-if-i-won-the-game)

How do I know if I won the game?

If you are the last person to click before the timer runs out, you will automatically receive the prize pool in your wallet when the next game starts. The game interface will also display a message indicating that you've won.

[](#token-questions)

Token Questions


-----------------------------------------

### 

[](#where-can-i-buy-click-me-tokens)

Where can I buy Click-Me tokens?

Click-Me tokens can be purchased on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on the Solana blockchain. Check the official website or social media channels for the current liquidity pools.

### 

[](#what-gives-click-me-tokens-value)

What gives Click-Me tokens value?

Click-Me tokens derive their utility from the ability to stake them and earn a portion of game fees (5% of all clicks). The tokens themselves have no intrinsic value beyond this utility.

### 

[](#is-there-a-lock-up-period-when-staking)

Is there a lock-up period when staking?

Yes, there is a timer that resets whenever you make changes to your staked or unstaked balance. Please be aware of this when planning your staking strategy.

[](#technical-questions)

-------------------------------------------------

### 

[](#what-wallet-can-i-use-to-play-click-me)

What wallet can I use to play Click-Me?

Click-Me supports most Solana-compatible wallets, including Phantom, Solflare, and others. Make sure your wallet is connected to the Solana mainnet to play.

### 

[](#are-the-smart-contracts-audited)

Are the smart contracts audited?

Our solana programs have been audited, tested and thoroughly reviewed for bugs. While this doesn't gaurantee 100% security, we have taken other measures to ensure the safety of our users. We have open sourced our front end here: https://github.com/CLICK-ME-ON-SOL/Click\_Me\_FE and we plan to open source our solana programs in the future.

### 

[](#what-happens-if-the-solana-network-is-congested)

What happens if the Solana network is congested?

During times of high network congestion, transactions may take longer to process or could fail. If this happens, you may need to retry your transaction when the network is less busy. Your funds will remain safe in your wallet if a transaction fails.
