Staking Rewards
===============

Stake and snag SOL from game madness. Here’s how it piles up and lands in your lap.

[](#cash-sources)

Cash Sources


-----------------------------------

Rewards straight from the grind:

*   **Clicks:** 5% of each (0.25 SOL up) hits the pool.
    
*   **New Games:** 5% of 3 SOL (0.15 SOL each) joins the party.
    

More action, more juice—stakers thrive on the chaos.

**Live Drip:** Rewards stack as players click—stake and watch it grow.

How It Splits


-------------------------------------

Your cut’s your stake’s slice of the pie:

Your Rewards = Total Rewards × (Your Stake ÷ Total Staked)

Got 5% of the pool? You’re pocketing 5% of the SOL haul—fair and square.
